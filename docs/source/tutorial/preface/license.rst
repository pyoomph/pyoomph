   -  The file `src/pyginacstruct.hpp <https://github.com/pyoomph/pyoomph/blob/main/src/pyginacstruct.hpp>`__ is strongly based on the file `structure.h <https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=blob_plain;f=ginac/structure.h;hb=HEAD>`__ of `GiNaC <https://www.ginac.de/>`__, `[GPL v2 or later license] <https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=blob_plain;f=COPYING;hb=HEAD>`__.

   -  A copy of the library `Project Nayuki/smallest enclosing circle <https://www.nayuki.io/page/smallest-enclosing-circle>`__, `[LGPL v3 or later license] <https://github.com/nayuki/Nayuki-web-published-code/blob/master/smallest-enclosing-circle/COPYING.LESSER.txt>`__ is added (after adding type specifications) to `pyoomph/utils/smallest_circle.py <https://github.com/pyoomph/pyoomph/blob/main/pyoomph/utils/smallest_circle.py>`__.

   -  Also, when using materials or the thermodynamic activity models AIOMFAC, original UNIFAC or modified UNIFAC (Dortmund), :ref:`please cite the relevant publications <secboxunifacinfo>`.

   The third-party licenses/acknowledgement files can be also found in `src/thirdparty <https://github.com/pyoomph/pyoomph/tree/main/src/thirdparty>`__.

#. During compilation, pyoomph includes/links against or makes use of the following libraries:

   -  `GiNaC <https://www.ginac.de/>`__, `[GPL v2 or later license] <https://www.ginac.de/ginac.git/?p=ginac.git;a=blob_plain;f=COPYING;hb=HEAD>`__, also statically linked in the distribution as python wheels

   -  `CLN <https://www.ginac.de/CLN>`__, `[GPL v2 or later license] <https://www.ginac.de/CLN/cln.git/?p=cln.git;a=blob_plain;f=COPYING;hb=HEAD>`__, also statically linked in the distribution as python wheels

   -  `TQMesh <https://github.com/FloSewn/TQMesh>`__, `[MIT license] <https://github.com/FloSewn/TQMesh/blob/main/LICENSE.md>`__, a two-dimensional mesh generator for triangular and quadrilateral elements. It is not part of the pyoomph repository, but downloaded at build time and statically linked in the distribution as python wheels. Minor modifications as mentioned in `src/thirdparty/INFO_tqmesh <https://github.com/pyoomph/pyoomph/blob/main/src/thirdparty/INFO_tqmesh>`__ are applied to the downloaded sources. It is optional, see the cmake option ``PYOOMPH_HAS_TQMESH``.

   -  `Spectra <https://spectralib.org>`__, `[MPL v2.0 license] <https://github.com/yixuan/spectra/blob/master/LICENSE>`__, a header-only library for large-scale eigenvalue problems, providing the ``"spectra"`` eigensolver backend. It is built on `Eigen <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org>`__, `[MPL v2.0 license] <https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/blob/master/COPYING.MPL2>`__. Neither is part of the pyoomph repository, but both are downloaded at build time and statically linked in the distribution as python wheels. Eigen is only *primarily* MPL2 - a few of its headers carry third-party BSD or LGPL code - so pyoomph compiles it with ``EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY``, which turns including any of those into a compile error. They are optional, see the cmake option ``PYOOMPH_HAS_SPECTRA``.

   -  MPI, depending on the system e.g. `OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org>`__ `[3-clause BSD license] <https://www.open-mpi.org/community/license.php>`__, `MPICH <https://www.mpich.org/>`__ `[MPICH license] <https://github.com/pmodels/mpich/blob/main/COPYRIGHT>`__, `Microsoft MPI <https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft-MPI>`__ `[MIT license] <https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-MPI/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`__, note that MPI support is experimental and deactivated in the python wheels

   -  `python3.10\ + <https://www.python.org/>`__, `[PSF license] <https://docs.python.org/3/license.html>`__, also dynamically linked in the distribution as python wheels

   -  `nanobind <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind>`__, `[BSD-style license] <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind/blob/master/LICENSE>`__, also statically linked in the distribution as python wheels; its bundled ``nanobind.stubgen`` is used to generate python stubs from the C++ core

   -  `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`__, `[MIT license] <https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/main/LICENSE.txt>`__

#. Beyond that, pyoomph makes use of the following libraries at runtime. During installation with pip, many (but not all) of these libraries are automatically fetched as requirements.

   -  `python core libraries <https://www.python.org/>`__, `[PSF license] <https://docs.python.org/3/license.html>`__

   -  `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`__, `[BSD license] <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/license.html>`__

   -  `shapely <https://github.com/shapely/shapely>`__, `[BSD 3-Clause license] <https://github.com/shapely/shapely/blob/main/LICENSE.txt>`__, only required by :py:mod:`pyoomph.meshes.axisymm_topology` to detect and plan axisymmetric pinch-off and coalescence. It is optional and can be installed with ``pip install pyoomph[topology]``

   -  `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`__, `[PSF-based license] <https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/project/license.html>`__

It is only required by :py:mod:`pyoomph.solvers.precice_adapter` to couple pyoomph with other solvers (cf. :numref:`secprecice`) and is optional; it is neither bundled nor installed as a pip requirement, see the `installation instructions <https://precice.org/installation-overview.html>`__
   
   -  `setuptools <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools>`__, `[MIT license] <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme>`__

   -  `cibuildwheel <https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io>`__, `[BSD 2-Clause license] <https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme>`__ is used to compile the provided wheels
