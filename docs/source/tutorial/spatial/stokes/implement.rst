Implementation of the Stokes equations and the inf-sup condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us now implement the aforementioned weak form of the Stokes equation. As usual, this requires only a few lines in pyoomph. However, there is some important requirement on the selection on the basis functions for the velocity and the pressure fields. To try out which choices of the discretizations work, we will allow the user to pass the spaces, e.g. ``"C1"`` or ``"C2"``, for the velocity and the pressure.

.. code:: python

   from pyoomph import *
   from pyoomph.expressions import *

   class StokesEquations(Equations):
   	# Passing the viscosity and the basis function space ("C1" or "C2") for velocity and pressure
   	def __init__(self,mu,uspace,pspace):
   		super(StokesEquations, self).__init__()
   		self.mu=mu # Store viscosity and the selected spaces
   		self.uspace=uspace
   		self.pspace=pspace
   		
   	def define_fields(self):
   		self.define_vector_field("velocity",self.uspace) # define a vector field called "velocity" on space uspace
   		self.define_scalar_field("pressure",self.pspace) # and a scalar field "pressure"
   		
   	def define_residuals(self):
   		u,v=var_and_test("velocity") # get the fields and the corresponding test functions
   		p,q=var_and_test("pressure")
   		# stress tensor, sym(A) applied on a matrix gives 1/2*(A+A^t), so this is -p+mu*(grad(u)+grad(u)^t)
   		stress=-p*identity_matrix()+2*self.mu*sym(grad(u))
   		self.add_residual(weak(stress,grad(v)) + weak(div(u),q)) # weak form of Stokes flow

We pass the viscosity as ``mu`` and the two spaces ``uspace`` and ``pspace`` to the constructor of the ``StokesEquations`` and store them internally. A vector field can be defined with :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.Equations.define_vector_field` within the specific implementation of :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.BaseEquations.define_fields`. This will automatically create a one-dimensional vector field on a mesh with one spatial dimension and correspondingly two-dimensional and three-dimensional vector fields on two-dimensional and three-dimensional meshes, respectively.

As a test problem, we implement the typical parabolic *Poiseuille flow*. This is achieved by considering a rectangular domain and imposing zero velocity at the top and at the bottom, a parabolic inflow in :math:`x`-direction at :math:`x=0` and an open outflow with :math:`u_y=0`:

.. code:: python

   		eqs=StokesEquations(self.mu,self.uspace,self.pspace) # Stokes equation using the viscosity and the spaces
   		eqs+=MeshFileOutput() # Add output to write PVD/VTU files to be viewed in paraview
   		
   		# Inflow: Parabolic u_x=y*(1-y), u_y=0
   		y=var("coordinate_y")
   		u_x_inflow=y*(1-y)
   		# Components of vector quantities can be accessed with the suffix "_x" or "_y" (or "_z" in 3d)
   		eqs+=DirichletBC(velocity_x=u_x_inflow,velocity_y=0)@"left"
   		
   		# Outflow, u_y=0, no Dirichlet on u_x, i.e. stress free outlet
   		eqs+=DirichletBC(velocity_y=0)@"right"
   		
   		# No slip conditions at top and bottom
   		eqs+=DirichletBC(velocity_x=0,velocity_y=0)@"bottom"
   		eqs+=DirichletBC(velocity_x=0,velocity_y=0)@"top"
   		
   		# Adding this to the default domain name "domain" of the RectangularQuadMesh above
   		self.add_equations(eqs@"domain")

Note how the components of the vectorial field :math:`u` can be accessed by ``u_x`` and ``u_y`` in two dimensions for setting e.g. Dirichlet boundary conditions. Furthermore, we take the viscosity and the discretization spaces for the velocity and the pressure as arguments for the problem constructor and pass them to the ``StokesEquations``.

By that, we can now easily try out different combinations for the finite element spaces by constructing a corresponding problem and solve it:

.. code:: python

   if __name__ == "__main__":		
   	# Create a Stokes problem with viscosity 1, quadratic velocity basis functions and linear pressure basis functions
   	with StokesSpaceTestProblem(1.0,"C2","C1") as problem: 
   		problem.solve() # solve and output
   		problem.output()

It is trivial to try out other pairs of spaces, but it turns out that for the choice of the continuous spaces ``"C1"`` and ``"C2"``, the only combination that leads to convergence and reasonable solutions is ``"C2"`` for the velocity and ``"C1"`` for the pressure. These combination is called *Taylor-Hood element*. Mathematically, the convergence or divergence/oscillations can be proven and the corresponding theorem is the so-called *inf-sup criterion* or *Ladyzhenskaya-Babuška-Brezzi condition*. In simple words, we have to be aware of the fact that the pressure acts as a field of Lagrange multipliers that enforces the incompressibility, i.e. :math:`\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u}=0`. The pressure field adjusts hence that way and couples back to the momentum equation that this condition is fulfilled. However, if we choose equal spaces for both velocity and pressure, we are actually over-constraining the requirement of :math:`\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u}=0`, i.e. we enforce it at too many localizations so that a solution cannot be found or suffers from checkerboard-like oscillations.

.. warning::

   Since the pressure acts as Lagrange multiplier field for the incompressibility, one should not be tempted to impose a Dirichlet boundary condition for the pressure, except for a single degree of freedom in a special case discussed later on in :numref:`secspatialstokesdim`.
