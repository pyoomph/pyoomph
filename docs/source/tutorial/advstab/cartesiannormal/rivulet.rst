Rayleigh-Plateau instability in presence of a substrate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous example was quite simple. In particular, the calculation of the dispersion relation could also have been done analyically by pen and paper.
However, the stability analysis in an additional Cartesian direction can be used to quickly investigate considerably more intricate problems.

Here, we want to consider a long printed line of a liquid on a substrate, also called rivulet. We assume that this rivulet is infinitely long in the :math:`z`-direction and its shape is independent on :math:`z`. Alternatively, we can also think of a such a rivulet confined between two plates with distance :math:`L=2\pi/k`, free slip conditions and an :math:`90^\circ` equilibrium contact angle with respect to the plate tangent.

In absence of a substrate, i.e. for a cylindrically shaped liquid bridge, it is well-known that it undergoes a Rayleigh-Plateau instability when :math:`L/R>2\pi`. However, how does the dynamics change if we consider a rivulet on a substrate instead? Of course, there must be a specific length (or wavenumber :math:`k` in :math:`z`-direction) when this printed line also undergoes a Rayleigh-Plateau instability, provided that we allow for some slip at the substrate. However, how does the critical wavenumber :math:`k` and the time scale of the instability depend on e.g. the contact angle with respect to the substrate and/or the slip length at the substrate?

We can easily find all the answers by expressing the shape of base solution only in the :math:`x`-:math:`y`-plane and let pyoomph calculate the stability of such a solution with respect to perturbations in the third direction :math:`z`. We will use Stokes flow for the liquid and combine it with a moving mesh to allow for shape deformations. Moreover, we only consider the right half (i.e. :math:`x\geq 0`) and thereby only selects modes which are symmetric with respect to :math:`x` in the following. Therefore, our mesh just creates half of the domain:

.. code:: python

	class RivuletMesh(GmshTemplate):
	    def define_geometry(self):
		self.default_resolution=0.1
		self.mesh_mode="tris"
		cl_factor=0.1 # Make it finer at the contact line
		pr=cast(RivuletProblem,self.get_problem())
		geom=DropletGeometry(volume=pi/2,rivulet_instead=True,contact_angle=pr.theta)
		p00=self.point(0,0)
		prl=self.point(-geom.base_radius,0,size=cl_factor*self.default_resolution) # Mirrored point for the circle_arc
		prr=self.point(geom.base_radius,0,size=cl_factor*self.default_resolution) # contact line
		p0h=self.point(0,geom.apex_height) # Top of the droplet

		self.circle_arc(prr,p0h,through_point=prl,name="interface")        
		self.line(prr,p00,name="substrate")
		        
		self.line(p00,p0h,name="axis")
		self.plane_surface("interface","substrate","axis",name="liquid")

Note how we use :py:class:`~pyoomph.utils.dropgeom.DropletGeometry` with the kwarg ``rivulet_instead=True`` to convert the volume and the contact angle (which we obtain from the problem defined later on) to the base radius and apex height. Using ``rivulet_instead=True`` actually converts the value shipped by ``volume`` as surface area of the circle segment. In particular, using the volume of :math:`\pi/2`, it gives a radius of curvature of unity for a contact angle :math:`\theta=90^\circ`.

For the problem class, we just define the two parameters (slip length and contact angle) and add all equations to the system:

.. code:: python

	class RivuletProblem(Problem):        
	    def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		# Contact angle and slip length
		self.theta,self.sliplength=self.define_global_parameter(theta=60*degree,sliplength=1) 
		
	    def define_problem(self):        
		self+=RivuletMesh() # Add a 2d mesh       
		
		# Assemble the equation system
		eqs=HyperelasticSmoothedMesh() # Moving mesh, Hyperelastic mesh is quite robust, since we do not remesh in this particular tutorial
		eqs+=NavierStokesEquations(dynamic_viscosity=1) # bulk flow
		# Boundary conditions:
		# Navier-slip and no penetration at the substrate
		eqs+=( NavierStokesSlipLength(sliplength=self.sliplength) + DirichletBC(velocity_y=0,mesh_y=0) )@"substrate"        
		# Free surface at the interface
		eqs+=NavierStokesFreeSurface(surface_tension=1)@"interface"        
		# Impose a contact angle at the contact line
		eqs+=NavierStokesContactAngle(contact_angle=self.theta)@"interface/substrate"  
		# Symmetry at the axis
		eqs+=DirichletBC(mesh_x=0,velocity_x=0)@"axis" 
		# Enforce the volume/area of the liquid by a pressure constraint
		eqs+=EnforceVolumeByPressure(volume=pi/4)        
		
		eqs+=MeshFileOutput()              
		 # Apply the equation system to the liquid domain
		self+=eqs@"liquid"
		
This only sets up the two-dimensional problem. The eigenanalysis with the additional normal mode is activated in the driver code:

.. code:: python

	problem=RivuletProblem() # Create the problem
	# Setup the problem for k-stability analysis, we do not need an analytic Hessian, since we don't do any bifurcation tracking
	problem.setup_for_stability_analysis(additional_cartesian_mode=True,analytic_hessian=False) 
	# Use the SLEPc eigensolver with MUMPS
	problem.set_eigensolver("slepc").use_mumps()
	problem.solve() # Solve the base state
	problem.save_state("start.dump") # Save the start case at 90°


	# Scan the contact angle
	for theta_deg in [60,90,120]:
	    problem.load_state("start.dump",ignore_outstep=True)
	    problem.go_to_param(theta=theta_deg*degree)        
	    # Scan the slip length (either essentially free slip or quite low slip length)
	    for sl in [10000,0.01]:        
		problem.go_to_param(sliplength=sl)    
	    
		outf=problem.create_text_file_output("for_"+str(round(float(problem.theta/degree)))+"_deg_SL_"+str(sl)+".txt",header=["k","Lambda"])

		for k in numpy.linspace(0.01,1.5,50):
		    problem.solve_eigenproblem(1,normal_mode_k=k) # Solve the k-dependent eigenproblem
		    evs=problem.get_last_eigenvalues()    
		    outf.add_row(k,numpy.real(evs[0]))


Again, it just takes the call of :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.setup_for_stability_analysis` with ``additional_cartesian_mode=True`` to activate this feature and shipping ``normal_mode_k=k`` to the call of :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.solve_eigenproblem`.

The eigenvalues are plotted in :numref:`figrivuletbranches`. It is apparent that, indepedently of the slip length, the critical wavenumber is at :math:`k=1` for :math:`\theta=90^\circ`, which is reasonable, since the problem can be essentially mirrored at both axis to get the conventional Rayleigh-Plateu instability (at least for high slip lengths). A smaller slip influences the magnitude of the eigenvalues, which is reasonable, since it damps the motion of the contact line. For other contact angles, it is different: Due to the fixed cross-sectional area of the rivulet, a change in contact angle influences the radius of curvature, therefore the critical wave number shifts. But the way it shifts now also depends on the slip length. In particular, the eigenfunctions show intense tangential flow at the contact line (:numref:`figrivuletplots`), which is strongly influenced by the slip length and hampered even more, the flatter the droplet is.

To visualize the eigenmodes, it is beneficial to modify the problem code above by adding some operators to the :py:class:`~pyoomph.output.meshio.MeshFileOutput`:

.. code:: python
	
	from pyoomph.meshes.meshdatacache import MeshDataCombineWithEigenfunction,MeshDataCartesianExtrusion
        eqs+=MeshFileOutput(operator=MeshDataCombineWithEigenfunction(0)+MeshDataCartesianExtrusion(50))    
        
Here :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.meshdatacache.MeshDataCombineWithEigenfunction` will combine the base state with the eigenfunction at index 0, so that both the base solution and the eigenfunction are written to the file for Paraview. :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.meshdatacache.MeshDataCartesianExtrusion` will apply the extrusion in the :math:`z`-direction, respecting the oscillation of the eigenmode with :math:`\exp(ikz)`. To write this output, add the :py:func:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.output` method of the :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem` to the driver code where you want to have output, however, after an :py:meth:`~pyoomph.generic.problem.Problem.solve_eigenproblem`, so that the eigensolution is available. Afterwards, you can load the files in Paraview, use the ``Calculator`` filter with an expression ``iHat*Eigen_coordinate_x+jHat*Eigen_coordinate_y`` to cast the mesh perturbation to a vector, combine it with ``Wrap by Vector`` and ``Reflect`` filters and you obtain plots like shown in :numref:`figrivuletplots`.
