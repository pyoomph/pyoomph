"""
Pyoomph is a finite element framework based on oomph-lib and GiNaC. It is designed to be a high-level interface to the oomph-lib library, providing an alternative way of invoking the power of oomph-lib via just-in-time compiled equations in python instead of the C++ templates of oomph-lib. The definition of weak forms is designed to be used in a similar way to FEniCS, but in an object-oriented approach.
