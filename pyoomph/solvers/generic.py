	What separates it from an ordinary ``RuntimeError`` (which it derives from, so existing ``except
	RuntimeError`` around a solve keeps working) is what pyoomph does with it. The solver shim
	(``src/nanobind/solver.cpp``) reports a ``SolverError`` to oomph-lib as a failed Newton solve, so an
	adaptive time step halves ``dt`` and an arclength step scales ``Ds`` by 2/3 and both retry, instead
	of the exception unwinding the whole run.

	Raise it only for failures a smaller step could plausibly fix. A solver that is misconfigured or
	unavailable -- no MUMPS in this PETSc build, an unmatched field-split name, Pardiso under MPI --
	must stay an ordinary error: it would fail identically on every retry, and the run would shrink its
	step until it underflowed and then blame the time step rather than showing the real message.

	Backends subclass it one per backend (``PardisoError``, ``PETScSolverError``, ``ScipySolverError``),
	so a caller can still tell which one gave up.

		one rank, from matrices that are identical across ranks, so the blocks cannot disagree.
