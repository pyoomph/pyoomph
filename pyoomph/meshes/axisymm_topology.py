"""Pure geometry for axisymmetric topology changes (pinch-off and coalescence).

This module is deliberately free of any pyoomph import: it only needs numpy, scipy's
``brentq`` and the optional dependency shapely.  That keeps it unit-testable without the
FEM stack and makes every dataclass here trivially picklable (numpy arrays and builtins
only), which is what an MPI broadcast of a computed :class:`SurgeryPlan` will need.

Coordinate convention (nondimensional throughout): ``x`` is the radial coordinate ``r``,
with the axis of symmetry at ``x = 0`` and all input points at ``x >= 0``; ``y`` is the
axial coordinate ``z``.

The detection is morphological.  The interface polylines are turned into a closed
half-section, mirrored about the axis into a full 2D cross section ``P``.  A neck of
minimal radius ``r_w`` then appears in ``P`` as a strip of *full* width ``2 r_w`` and an
axial gap of length ``d`` between two fragments appears as a gap of length ``d``.  See
:func:`_open` / :func:`_close` for the derivation of the structuring-element radii that
make the detection thresholds come out at exactly ``rmin_nd`` and ``distmin_nd``.

    *timing* statement rather than a verdict on the parameters: the waist of a collapsing neck is
    still growing in axial extent while it thins, so the very step at which the minimum radius first
    crosses ``rmin_nd`` is essentially always too early (measured on the Rayleigh-Plateau test:
    exactly one step too early, at every ``rmin_nd`` tried). Its own type is what lets
    :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.topological_changes.AxisymmetricReconnection` retry on the next

    """


class InterfaceStateNotPlannable(RuntimeError):
    """The interface handed in cannot be turned into a cross section this module can reason about.

    Several shapes reach it, before the morphology and after it: a chain whose ring
    self-intersects; a union that already encloses a hole, or a reconnection that would create one;
    a fragment that does not touch the symmetry axis (a ring - see ``reservoir_depth``), and its
    mirror twin, which clips to nothing at ``x >= 0``; and a fragment left with no interface at all.
    All of them used to end the run, and all of them are states a *transient* can pass through,
    because
    :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.topological_changes.AxisymmetricReconnection` detects after every
    Newton solve - including the solves of steps that are about to be rejected on temporal error or
    on a Newton failure, whose interface is an intermediate that no one ever asked to keep. Measured
    on the Rayleigh-Plateau pinch-off tutorial: the retracting caps of a fresh satellite produce one
    of these in roughly one run in thirty, a couple of steps after the event, and the run died on it
    although the very next attempt at a smaller ``dt`` was fine.

    So it has its own type, like :py:class:`WaistNotYetSeparable`: the caller declines to plan on
    that solve and tries again on the next one. A state that is genuinely - not transiently - beyond
    this module still ends the run, once ``max_unplannable_states`` consecutive solves have seen it.

#
# Derivation of the structuring-element radii.
#
# *Opening* (erosion followed by dilation, `P.buffer(-e).buffer(+e)`) deletes exactly
# those parts of the fluid that cannot contain an open disc of radius `e`.  Because the
# half-section has been mirrored about the axis, a neck whose minimal interface radius is
# `r_w` is a full-width strip of half-width `r_w`, whose medial axis is the symmetry axis
# itself.  Erosion by `e` therefore empties the neck (and hence disconnects the fragment)
# precisely when `r_w < e`.  So `eps_p = rmin_nd`, NOT `rmin_nd/2`: the mirroring already
# supplies the factor of two.  With that choice the pinch threshold is exactly
# "minimal interface radius below rmin_nd".
#
# *Closing* (dilation followed by erosion, `Q.buffer(+e).buffer(-e)`) fills exactly those
# parts of the complement that cannot contain an open disc of radius `e`.  Two fragments
# separated by an axial gap of length `d` each grow by `e` under the dilation, so they
# touch when `2 e >= d`.  So `eps_c = distmin_nd/2` and the coalescence threshold is
# exactly "tip-to-tip gap below distmin_nd".
#
# The three-step composites `+e,-2e,+e` and `-e,+2e,-e` were rejected on purpose.
# `P.buffer(+e).buffer(-2e).buffer(+e)` is not an opening: regrouping it as
# `((P (+e) (-e)) (-e) (+e))` shows it is the opening OF THE CLOSING, i.e. it silently
# bridges every gap shorter than `2 eps_p` as well.  That couples the two thresholds and
# makes the combined neck+gap case ambiguous (a pinch would immediately be re-bridged by
# its own detector).  The plain two-step forms above are the textbook opening/closing,
# they commute with the intended thresholds, and they are what the unit tests pin down.
#
# Two genuine caveats remain, and both are diagnosed rather than papered over.
#
# (i) It is the *erosion* that carries the topology; the dilation which completes the
#     opening re-glues two eroded components whenever they end up closer than `2 eps_p`,
#     i.e. whenever the waist is axially shorter than the structuring element.  A physical
#     pinch-off neck is long and slender, so this only shows up when rmin_nd is coarse
#     compared with the axial extent of the waist.  The component counts of the erosion and
#     of the opening are compared and a mismatch raises rather than silently reporting no
#     event.  With that guarded, the pinch threshold is exactly "minimum interface radius
#     below rmin_nd".
#
#     It raises as `WaistNotYetSeparable`, a type of its own, because a *collapsing* neck
#     always hits it once: at the step where the minimum radius first drops below rmin_nd
#     the waist is thinner than the structuring element over an axial stretch that has only
#     just opened, and it is the next step or two of thinning that makes it long enough.
#     Measured on the Rayleigh-Plateau physics test, over eps_p from 0.02 to 0.15 R0, it was
#     exactly one step every time.  The caller retries rather than ending the run; only a
#     genuinely too-coarse rmin_nd keeps failing, and then it fails differently (the caps
#     overlap, or a child fragment retains no old point).
#
# (ii) If the axial gap that the opening carves out at a waist is itself shorter than
#      `distmin_nd`, the subsequent closing would immediately re-merge the two pinch
#      children.  That is a contradictory parameter choice (rmin_nd too large relative to
#      distmin_nd), and it raises too.

    the same amount.
