"""
Shared machinery for residual-based stabilization, and the SUPG/GLS/ASGS stabilization of the
*scalar transport* equations (advection-diffusion, mixture composition, temperature).

The free functions at the top -- :py:func:`element_h`, :py:func:`inv_dt`,
:py:func:`regularized_magnitude`, :py:func:`tau_advective_diffusive` -- are the pieces that the
momentum stabilization in :py:mod:`pyoomph.equations.stabilized_ns` and the scalar transport
stabilization here have in common. They live in this module rather than being written twice, so
that a fix to :math:`\\tau` cannot land in one of the two and not the other.

:py:class:`ScalarTransportEquations` is the common base class of
:py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.advection_diffusion.AdvectionDiffusionEquations`,
:py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.multi_component.CompositionAdvectionDiffusionEquations` and
:py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.multi_component.TemperatureConductionEquation`, each of which supplies
its own strong residual. All of them take a single ``stabilization`` keyword argument, which is off
by default; see :py:class:`ScalarTransportStabilization`.

It is a base class rather than a mixin because ``Equations`` is a nanobind type, and nanobind
permits exactly one base -- ``class Foo(Mixin, Equations)`` fails at class-creation time with
"nb_type_init(): invalid number of bases!".

Everything except the discontinuity capturing term is proportional to the *strong* residual of the
transport equation and therefore vanishes for the exact solution: a consistent stabilization must
not change the answer, only the conditioning.

    """
    Settings for the residual-based stabilization of a scalar transport equation.

    Pass an instance -- or, for the common case, just the ``terms`` string, which is promoted to one
    -- as the ``stabilization`` argument of
    :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.advection_diffusion.AdvectionDiffusionEquations`,
    :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.multi_component.CompositionAdvectionDiffusionEquations` or the
    temperature equations. ``None`` or ``"none"`` means no stabilization at all, which is the
    default everywhere.

    The added terms per element interior are, with :math:`v` the test function of the transported
    field, :math:`\\vec{a}=\\vec{u}-\\vec{u}_\\text{mesh}` the advecting velocity relative to the
    mesh and :math:`R` the strong residual of the transport equation,

    .. math::

        \\text{SUPG}\\quad &\\sum_K (\\tau\\,\\vec{a}\\cdot\\nabla v,\\; R)_K \\\\

        \\text{DC}\\quad &\\sum_K (\\hat\\rho\\,\\nu_\\text{dc}\\,\\mathbf{P}\\nabla c,\\;\\nabla v)_K

    The first two are proportional to :math:`R` and hence vanish for the exact solution. The
    discontinuity capturing term does not: it is an artificial diffusivity whose *magnitude* is
    driven by :math:`R`, so it decreases under refinement but is not zero on a representable
    solution. It is also the only term written against :math:`\\nabla v`, so it is the only one that
    changes the natural boundary condition of the transported field. Both are why it is off by
    default.

    Args:
        terms: a key of :py:data:`SCALAR_STABILIZATION_PRESETS`, an iterable of the individual flags
            ``"SUPG"``, ``"GLSDIFF"``, ``"ASGSDIFF"``, ``"DC"``, or ``None``/``"none"``.
        tau_formula: ``"shakib"``, ``"codina"`` or ``"tezduyar"``, see
            :py:func:`tau_advective_diffusive`. The classical nodally exact one-dimensional choice
            :math:`\\tau=\\frac{h}{2|a|}(\\coth\\mathrm{Pe}-1/\\mathrm{Pe})` is deliberately *not*
            offered: it is 0/0 as :math:`\\mathrm{Pe}\\to0` and would need a series expansion around
            that limit, which pyoomph's symbolic layer does not have.
        C_I: coefficient of the diffusive term in :math:`\\tau`. The default 4 is inherited from
            :py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.stabilized_ns.StabilizedNavierStokes`, where it was
            measured to be on the diffusive side; it has *not* been measured for scalar transport.
        c_t: coefficient of the transient term in :math:`\\tau`.
        c_r: coefficient of the reaction term in :math:`\\tau`, i.e. of whatever
            :py:meth:`ScalarTransportEquations.stabilization_reaction_rate` returns.
        reaction_eps: regularization of that rate, relative to ``1/scale_factor("temporal")``. The
            rate enters :math:`\\tau` as a magnitude, and ``absolute()`` has a 0/0 derivative at the
            origin -- where a reaction rate proportional to the solution genuinely sits on a uniform
            initial condition.
        stab_factor: prefactor on :math:`\\tau`, for sensitivity studies. It does **not** scale
            :math:`\\nu_\\text{dc}`, which has its own ``dc_factor`` -- so switching everything off
            takes ``stab_factor=0, dc_factor=0``, as
            ``tests/test_stabilized_transport.py::test_stab_factor_zero_is_bitwise_identical``
            does. (This entry used to claim it scaled both.)
        transient_tau: include the :math:`1/\\Delta t` term in :math:`\\tau`. ``"auto"`` uses the
            BDF1 weight, which pyoomph zeroes in a steady solve, so the term switches itself off
            there.
        include_diffusion_in_residual: keep the second-derivative diffusive term
            :math:`\\nabla\\cdot(D\\nabla c)` in the strong residual. Switch it off on a mesh of
            linear simplices, and on wedges, pyramids and 0d domains it must be off; see
            *When to switch off the diffusive term* below. The momentum counterpart is
            :py:attr:`~pyoomph.equations.stabilized_ns.StabilizedNavierStokes.include_viscous_in_residual`.
        conservative_residual: whether the *advective* part of the strong residual is written in
            conservative form :math:`\\nabla\\cdot(\\vec{a}c)` or convective form
            :math:`\\vec{a}\\cdot\\nabla c`. ``"auto"`` mirrors whatever the equation actually
            assembles. The two differ by :math:`c\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{a}`, which is not zero for a
            variable density or a compressible wind.
        velocity_eps: :math:`|\\vec{a}|` is regularized as
            :math:`\\sqrt{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{a}+(\\varepsilon U)^2}` so that :math:`\\tau` stays
            differentiable at rest. Given *relative* to the velocity scale, so that it remains
            meaningful in a dimensional problem.
        velocity_scale: name of the scale used for that regularization.
        dc_factor: prefactor on the discontinuity capturing diffusivity.
        dc_form: ``"crosswind"`` adds the artificial diffusivity only perpendicular to the
            streamline, so it does not spoil the streamline accuracy SUPG buys; ``"isotropic"`` adds
            it in all directions.
        dc_eps: relative regularization of :math:`|\\nabla c|` and :math:`|R|` in
            :math:`\\nu_\\text{dc}`.
        dc_subtract_supg: use Codina's capped form, i.e. subtract the diffusivity SUPG already
            supplies and floor at zero, see :py:meth:`ScalarTransportEquations.dc_diffusivity`. On by
            default: the uncapped ratio is unbounded and does not switch itself off on a smooth
            solution, which makes it unusable at ``dc_factor`` = 1.
        natural_bc_correction: which parts of the stabilization's footprint on the natural boundary
            condition the flux boundary conditions should subtract, so that they impose the physical
            flux rather than the physical flux plus that footprint. ``True`` for all of them,
            ``False`` (the default) for none, or an iterable of ``"SUPG"``, ``"DC"``. See
            :py:meth:`ScalarTransportStabilizationMixin.get_stabilization_flux`.

    **When to switch off the diffusive term.** On an affine element map the second derivatives of C1
    shape functions vanish identically, so ``include_diffusion_in_residual`` contributes nothing and
    computing it is pure cost -- measured, dropping it changes the residual by 0 on triangles and 0
    on tets, and saves about 1.37x on Jacobian assembly (the whole second-derivative shape machinery
    stops being generated). This is the case where turning it off is free rather than an
    approximation. Measured relative change of the residual when dropping it elsewhere:

    ===========================  ========
    C1 triangles / tets           0
    C1 quads, undistorted         1.8e-17
    C1 quads, bilinearly warped   2.4e-02
    C2 triangles                  1.4e-01
    C2 tets                       1.6e-01
    ===========================  ========

    The undistorted-quad entry is real but fragile, and not a reason to switch this on for a quad
    mesh: a bilinear Q1 function has :math:`\\partial_{xx}=\\partial_{yy}=0` only while the elements
    stay rectangles, which any mesh distortion -- and every moving mesh -- ends. The safe rule is the
    simplex one. It must also be off on wedges, pyramids and 0d domains, where second derivatives are
    unavailable at all.
