"""Topological changes of an axisymmetric free surface: pinch-off and coalescence.

The two pieces here work as a pair.

* :py:class:`AxisymmetricReconnection` is an :py:class:`~pyoomph.generic.codegen.InterfaceEquations`
  attached to the free interface. After each successful Newton solve it hands the current interface
  polylines to :py:func:`pyoomph.meshes.axisymm_topology.detect_and_plan`, which decides -
  morphologically, on the mirrored cross section - whether a neck has thinned below ``rmin`` or two
  fragments have approached to within ``distmin``, and returns a
  :py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.axisymm_topology.SurgeryPlan` describing the interface *after* the
  event. The plan is parked on the mesh template and a remesh is requested.

* :py:class:`TopologicalChangesTemplate` is the mesh template that consumes the plan - as
  :py:class:`TopologicalChangesGmshTemplate` or :py:class:`TopologicalChangesTQMeshTemplate`. The
  surgery is delivered through the ordinary remeshing-by-recreation path: pyoomph calls
  ``define_geometry`` again, and there :py:meth:`~_TopologicalChangesMixin.get_reconnected_boundaries`
  returns the interface chains and axis spans that the new geometry has to be built from - the
  reconnected ones if an event was planned, the current ones if this is a plain quality remesh. The
  user code that turns them into splines and lines is the same in both cases.

This replaces the previous ``AxisymmetricPinchoffAndCoalescence``, which edited a
:py:class:`~pyoomph.meshes.remesher.Remesher2d`'s point and line entries in place. The reasons for
the clean break, rather than a port:

* the detection was a spline fit of ``r(arclength)`` per interface segment, so it could only see a
  waist *within one* segment and never the merging of two, and it depended on the knot placement of
  the fit;
* the surgery inserted two hand-placed points per new tip and left the volume to chance;
* it needed a ``Remesher2d``, i.e. a geometry reconstructed from the deformed mesh, which is the one
  remeshing path that cannot use the user's own ``define_geometry``.

Coordinate convention throughout: ``x`` is the radial coordinate with the symmetry axis at ``x = 0``,
``y`` is the axial coordinate.

**Under** ``--distribute``. The detection is a statement about the whole interface - where its
thinnest waist is, which fragments face each other across which gap - and a rank's partition of it is
not a piece of that answer but a different, truncated shape, cut wherever the partition happens to
run. So the interface is merged (collective), the plan is made on rank 0 and broadcast, and every
rank parks the identical plan on the template. Everything after that needs no communication of its
own: ``define_geometry`` is already a collective region, ``get_reconnected_boundaries`` reads the
parked plan (or the equally collective
:py:meth:`~pyoomph.meshes.mesh.MeshedMeshTemplate.get_boundary_coordinates`), and the zeta chart is
written by each rank onto the nodes it holds. The overlap guard takes the same route, because it too
compares two tips that are routinely on different ranks. Serial and ``mpirun`` without
``--distribute`` take the local path unchanged and communicate nothing at all.

          measured on the printhead at 1.2x drive, ~60 times while ``dt`` fell from 1e-7 to 7.3e-13

          ``actions_before_newton_convergence_check()`` again on the *restored* state, i.e. outside
          any solve, so the rejection also set the abort flag that the retry's first
          ``get_residuals`` then consumed: the retry could not even assemble.
        * one that is below the limit but no worse than it was. As ``dt`` -> 0 the gap tends to the
          baseline, so a guard that rejects there does not terminate either.

        A pair is therefore rejected only if it began the step on the right side of the limit and
        this step would both breach it and close the gap further. A pair that is already past it is

    condition, but its neighbours are not, and one Newton step of a strongly curved cap is enough.

    Rayleigh-Plateau runs at the coarse resolution, i.e. as an intermittent failure some way after
    the event that caused it.
