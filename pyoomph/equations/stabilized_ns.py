"""
Residual-based stabilization of the Navier-Stokes equations: SUPG, PSPG, LSIC/grad-div, GLS, ASGS
and VMS, together with the inf-sup unstable equal-order velocity/pressure pairs they make usable.

:py:class:`StabilizedNavierStokes` subclasses
:py:class:`~pyoomph.equations.navier_stokes.NavierStokesEquations`, so every interface equation of
that module keeps working -- free surface, slip length, contact angle, connect-velocity, the
azimuthal stability machinery -- and the ALE/GCL handling comes for free. Those interface equations
that impose a *traction* additionally compensate the footprint that the stabilization leaves on the
natural boundary condition; see
:py:meth:`~pyoomph.equations.navier_stokes.StokesEquations.get_stabilization_traction` and
:py:attr:`StabilizedNavierStokes.natural_bc_correction`.

All added terms are proportional to the *strong* momentum residual and therefore vanish for the
exact solution: a consistent stabilization must not change the answer, only the conditioning. The
strong residual contains :math:`-\\nabla\\cdot(2\\mu\\mathbf{D}(\\vec{u}))`, which needs second
derivatives of the shape functions; pyoomph has those, so the scheme here is genuinely consistent
rather than dropping the term. On a quadratic velocity space dropping it costs three orders of
magnitude in the pressure error, so it is not an approximation one can make silently.

This module replaces the former ``pyoomph.equations.SUPG``, which added the stabilization
*alongside* the flow equations instead of subclassing them and whose strong residual omitted the
viscous term. Its ``ElementSizeForSUPG`` helper is gone too: the element length scale is available
directly as ``var("cartesian_element_length_h")``.

    .. _StabilizedNavierStokes:

    Navier-Stokes equations with switchable residual-based stabilization. A subclass of
    :ref:`NavierStokesEquations <NavierStokesEquations>`, so it accepts all of its arguments as well.

    The added terms are, per element interior,

    .. math::

        \\text{SUPG}\\quad &\\sum_K (\\tau_M\\,\\vec{a}\\cdot\\nabla\\vec{v},\\; \\vec{R}_M)_K \\\\
        \\text{PSPG}\\quad &\\sum_K (\\tau_M/\\rho\\; \\nabla q,\\; \\vec{R}_M)_K \\\\
        \\text{LSIC}\\quad &\\sum_K (\\tau_C\\rho\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{u},\\; \\nabla\\cdot\\vec{v})_K

    with :math:`\\vec{a}=\\vec{u}-\\vec{u}_\\text{mesh}` and the strong momentum residual

    .. math:: \\vec{R}_M = \\rho\\left(\\partial_t\\vec{u} + \\vec{a}\\cdot\\nabla\\vec{u}\\right)
              + \\nabla p - \\nabla\\cdot(2\\mu\\mathbf{D}(\\vec{u})) - \\vec{f} - \\rho\\vec{g}\\,.

    GLS and ASGS add the viscous part of the perturbation operator (with the operator's own sign and
    with the adjoint sign, respectively), VMS adds the fine-scale Reynolds stress.

    Args:
        space: ``"C2C1"``/``"TH"`` (Taylor-Hood, inf-sup stable), ``"C1C1"``/``"C1"`` or
            ``"C2C2"``/``"C2"`` (equal order, inf-sup *unstable* -- these need PSPG or the pressure
            checkerboards and the system becomes effectively singular), also ``"CR"`` and
            ``"mini"``. An alias for the ``mode`` argument of the base class.
        viscous_form: ``"stress"`` uses :math:`2\\mu\\,\\text{sym}(\\nabla\\vec{u})` and hence the
            natural condition :math:`\\vec{n}\\cdot(2\\mu\\mathbf{D}) - p\\vec{n} = \\vec{t}`;
            ``"laplace"`` uses :math:`\\mu\\nabla\\vec{u}` and hence
            :math:`\\mu\\partial_n\\vec{u} - p\\vec{n} = \\vec{t}`. The two are identical in the bulk
            for a divergence-free field and constant viscosity but *not* on a Neumann boundary: with
            the stress form a developed channel profile is not a solution of the traction-free
            outflow, with the Laplace form it is. A free surface must use the stress form, since the
            traction there has to be the true stress.
        stabilization: a key of :py:data:`STABILIZATION_PRESETS` or an iterable of the individual
            flags ``"SUPG"``, ``"PSPG"``, ``"LSIC"``, ``"GLSVISC"``, ``"ASGSVISC"``, ``"REYNOLDS"``.
        tau_formula: ``"shakib"`` (Bazilevs/Codina-Shakib, the inverse square root of the sum of
            squares), ``"codina"`` (inverse of the sum) or ``"tezduyar"``.
        tauC_formula: ``"codina"`` (:math:`h^2/(c_C\\tau_M)`) or ``"tezduyar"``.
        include_viscous_in_residual: keep :math:`-\\nabla\\cdot(2\\mu\\mathbf{D})` in the strong
            residual. Switch it off on a mesh of linear simplices, and on wedges, pyramids and 0d
            domains it must be off; see *When to switch off the viscous term* below. The
            scalar-transport counterpart is
            :py:attr:`~pyoomph.equations.stabilization.ScalarTransportStabilization.include_diffusion_in_residual`.
        constant_viscosity: assume :math:`\\nabla\\mu=0` when forming
            :math:`\\nabla\\cdot(2\\mu\\mathbf{D})`. Set to False for a variable viscosity, which
            makes GiNaC differentiate through it.
        transient_tau: include the :math:`1/\\Delta t` term in :math:`\\tau`. ``"auto"`` uses the
            BDF1 weight, which pyoomph zeroes in a steady solve, so the term switches itself off
            there.
        natural_bc_correction: which parts of the stabilization's footprint on the natural boundary
            condition the traction boundary conditions should subtract, so that they impose the
            physical traction rather than the physical traction plus that footprint. ``True`` for
            all of them, ``False`` (the default) for none, or an iterable of ``"SUPG"``, ``"LSIC"``,
            ``"REYNOLDS"``. It defaults to off because it is a trade-off rather than a free
            improvement, see *When to correct the natural boundary condition* below.
        C_I: coefficient of the viscous term in :math:`\\tau_M`; :math:`\\tau_M\\to h^2/(C_I\\nu)` in
            the Stokes limit. The default 4 is what the textbook formula writes but is on the
            diffusive side; 36 converges measurably better.
        c_t: coefficient of the transient term in :math:`\\tau_M`.
        c_C: coefficient in :math:`\\tau_C = h^2/(c_C\\tau_M)`.
        c_r: coefficient of the linear-drag rate in :math:`\\tau_M`, see
            :py:meth:`StabilizedNavierStokes.linear_drag_rate`.
        velocity_eps: :math:`|\\vec{u}|` is regularized as
            :math:`\\sqrt{\\vec{u}\\cdot\\vec{u}+(\\varepsilon U)^2}` so that :math:`\\tau` stays
            differentiable at rest. Given *relative* to the velocity scale, so that it remains
            meaningful in a dimensional problem.
        stab_factor: global prefactor on both :math:`\\tau`'s, for sensitivity studies.

    **When to switch off the viscous term.** On an affine element map the second derivatives of C1
    shape functions vanish identically, so ``include_viscous_in_residual`` contributes nothing and
    computing it is pure cost -- measured, dropping it changes the residual by exactly 0 on C1
    triangles, and saves about 1.37x on Jacobian assembly. On C1 quads it depends on the viscous
    form, which is easy to get wrong: the stress form assembles
    :math:`\\mu(\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla\\vec{u} + \\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{u}))`, and the second term
    contains the *mixed* derivative :math:`\\partial_{xy}u`, which a bilinear map does not kill even
    on an undistorted rectangle. Measured on C1 quads: **4.0e-01** with ``viscous_form="stress"``
    (the default) against 0 with ``"laplace"``. So the simplex rule is the safe one; a quad mesh only
    qualifies in the Laplace form, and then only while it stays undistorted. Dropping it on C2
    velocities costs three orders of magnitude in the pressure error (dev_docs §2). It must also be
    off on wedges, pyramids and 0d domains, where second derivatives do not exist.

    **When to correct the natural boundary condition.** Measured on C1/C1 Poiseuille with the exact
    traction prescribed at the outflow (so that the parabola is not representable and the footprint
    is genuinely nonzero), switching the LSIC correction on reduces the pressure error *at* that
    boundary by a uniform 21 % but degrades the global pressure convergence from O(h^1.9) to
    O(h^1.6); the SUPG part contributes almost nothing either way. On a static free surface the whole
    thing is a wash. Switch ``natural_bc_correction`` on when the traction on a particular boundary
    is the quantity of interest -- an imposed load, a measured force, a coupling to another domain --
    and leave it off when the field in the interior is.

        The traction that the bulk stabilization terms deposit on a boundary, see

        Every stabilization term written against ``grad(v)`` contributes a surface integral when it
        is integrated by parts, so the natural condition of the stabilized formulation reads
        :math:`\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\vec{\\sigma}}+\\vec{t}_\\text{stab}=\\vec{t}` with

        .. math:: \\vec{t}_\\text{stab} = \\tau_M(\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{n})\\vec{R}_M
                  + \\tau_C\\rho\\,(\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{u})\\,\\vec{n}
                  - \\frac{\\tau_M^2}{\\rho}(\\vec{R}_M\\cdot\\vec{n})\\vec{R}_M

        from SUPG, LSIC and the VMS Reynolds term respectively. Each is proportional to a residual
        that vanishes for the exact solution, so subtracting them keeps the formulation consistent
        while making the prescribed traction the physical one on a finite mesh.

        The GLS/ASGS viscous perturbation is not in the list: it multiplies second derivatives of
        the test function rather than ``grad(v)``, so its effect on the boundary is not expressible
        as a traction.

        The PSPG term also has a surface footprint, :math:`(\\tau_M/\\rho)q\\,\\vec{R}_M\\cdot\\vec{n}`
        in the continuity equation, and it is deliberately *not* compensated anywhere: with
        :math:`q=1` the PSPG term drops out of the discrete continuity equation altogether, so
        global mass conservation is exact as it stands, and adding a boundary flux would break it.
        :py:class:`StabilizationBoundaryFlux` offers it for experiments.

        Which of the three are actually returned is selected by ``natural_bc_correction``, which
        defaults to *none*. Correcting the SUPG footprint measurably reduces the error at the
        boundary but degrades the global pressure convergence, because the uncorrected outflow term
        is part of what makes SUPG stable there.
