"""RemeshWhen(on_inverted_element=True): remeshing as the response to a folded mesh.

The case is the notch of `dev_docs/examples/inverted_element_notch.py`. A Laplace-smoothed mesh on a
unit square, with a Gaussian notch of linearly growing depth pushed into the top edge. The domain
stays meshable throughout; what folds at t = 0.1565 is the harmonic extension into a non-convex
shape. That matters, because it makes the fold a discretisation artefact a remesh genuinely repairs
rather than a domain collapsing, which nothing could repair.

**No step size gets past it.** The deformation is a function of t alone, so the fold sits at a fixed
TIME: halving dt only approaches it more slowly, and the mesh is folded at t_fold + eps for every
eps > 0. Without the trigger the run therefore dies there, and `test_without_the_trigger_the_run_dies_at_the_fold`
pins exactly that - it is what stops the positive test below from passing for some unrelated reason.

Everything runs in a subprocess, because `set_detect_inverted_elements` is process-wide.
