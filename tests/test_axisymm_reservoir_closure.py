"""InterfaceChain.reservoir: what is behind a wall contact line.

A ``"fixed"`` chain end is closed synthetically, and the plain closure runs straight across at the
contact height. That is right for a drop cut by a symmetry plane, where there is nothing behind the
contact, and wrong for a nozzle meniscus, where the liquid continues up the nozzle: the closure then
cuts the reservoir off and what the morphology sees is the sliver in front of the interface.

Two failure modes follow, both of them from a perfectly ordinary meniscus and neither of them
anything to do with a topological change:

* a meniscus **dimpled** near the axis leaves a sliver thinner than ``2 rmin``, which the erosion
  either erases entirely or - worse - hollows into a ring, whose mirrored cross section does not
  touch the axis and cannot be represented at all;
* a meniscus that **crosses** the contact height is cut by its own closure, i.e. the cross section
  self-intersects.

``reservoir`` says how deep the liquid goes behind the contact line and along which direction, and
the closure then follows the wall instead. These are direct calls of ``detect_and_plan``, no mesh
and no Problem: it is the plan that is under test.
