# The script that test_state_file_restart.py's --runmode continue tests interrupt and resume. It is a
# separate process on purpose: "continue" is decided by the command line and by the state files under
# the output directory, so it cannot be exercised from inside a single pytest process.
#
# One driven scalar ODE, integrated by the same run() machinery a PDE would use. No mesh is needed to
# see the effect - what is being compared is the sequence of time steps and the BDF2 history that goes
# with it - and an ODE keeps the run cheap enough to do six of them per test.

# pytest_ignore_collect applies to a file named on the command line). At import time the variable is
# not set, and reading it here turned collection into a KeyError.
