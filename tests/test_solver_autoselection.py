# Which solvers "import pyoomph" settles on when nobody says. Each case here is a fresh interpreter
# with some backends made unimportable, which is the only honest way to test it: what both cascades
# really depend on is whether an import succeeds. (The linear one also runs once, inline, at import
# time, so it cannot be re-evaluated in-process with a different answer at all.)
#
# LINEAR, non-macOS:
#     pardiso -> petsc_mumps -> mumps -> superlu
# pardiso and petsc_mumps stay in front so that no existing installation changes solver. "mumps" (the
# standalone MUMPS from the separate pyoomph_mumps package) sits ahead of superlu, and on macOS ahead
# of accelerate too, because it is a real sparse direct solver and they are the last resort.
#
# EIGEN:
#     slepc_mumps -> spectra(+Pardiso) -> mumps -> spectra(+SuperLU) -> pardiso -> accelerate -> scipy
# Spectra is compiled into pyoomph, so it is available on every build and nothing placed after it
# could ever be reached. What actually varies is the factorisation of J - sigma*M behind the same
# Arnoldi iteration - MKL Pardiso, MUMPS, or scipy's SuperLU - which is why the MUMPS backend belongs
# BETWEEN the two Spectra outcomes rather than after them.
#
# Getting either wrong is not loud: every one of these backends returns an answer, so a mis-ordered
# cascade shows up as a machine that is quietly several times slower than it should be.
