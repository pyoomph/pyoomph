# ========================================================================

# Restarting from a state file must put the problem in the state the writer was in, and the run must
# then continue as if it had never been interrupted. Two different claims, and the second one is the
# one that was broken:
#
# The state itself was always restored exactly. But the next solve(timestep=...) took the branch for
# the very first unsteady step -- a freshly built problem has _taken_already_an_unsteady_step False --
# which re-initialises dt, re-applies the initial condition and resets the step counter, so the step
# ran with the degraded FIRST-ORDER start instead of continuing the scheme. The restarted run then
# drifted from the uninterrupted one by O(dt^2).
#
# That is invisible on a problem that has settled: with du/dt ~ 0, BDF1 and BDF2 agree, and a
# diffusion problem run to near-steady state reproduces to 1e-16 either way. The moving-mesh case
# below, driven by a boundary that keeps moving, showed 4.9e-4. Hence a genuinely time-dependent case
# is part of this file on purpose.
#
# Compared here: the residual vector, every history level, the pinned values and the Jacobian, all of
# which have to be bit-identical right after loading; then the same quantities after continuing, where
# each side has done its own Newton solves and round-off is allowed.

# analysis with a different matrix than an uninterrupted one, so the reused analysis is not the same,
# and the numeric factorisation differs in the last bits. Verified by elimination: with
# reuse_symbolic_factorisation=False, Pardiso is bitwise as well. It is NOT thread nondeterminism
# either - unchanged with MKL_NUM_THREADS=1. (try_to_reuse_solver, which would reuse the NUMERIC

# The same claim for --runmode continue, which is how a state file is actually used: a killed run is
# restarted and has to carry on where it stopped. Three ways in which it did not, all of them in the
# bookkeeping of run() rather than in the state itself:
#
#  * The run loop shortens a step so it lands exactly on an output time and gives the shortening back
#    afterwards - but the state file is written by that very output(), i.e. BEFORE the restoration, so
#    it recorded the clamped step as "the step I was about to take". A resumed run(timestep=0.037,
#    outstep=0.1) then continued with 0.026 forever: a different time discretisation, off by O(dt^2).
#  * A run statement that had never been entered inherited the previous statement's time step, because
#    the state file did not say which statement wrote it (dump version 0.1.5 does).
#  * The output grid of a run(numouts=...) is rebuilt from the resume time, so the instant being
#    resumed AT landed an ulp in the future and the first step asked for was ~5e-17 - which the Newton
#    solver cannot converge, and the continued run died on the spot.
#
# Each variant is run three times: uninterrupted, interrupted, and resumed. Only the ODE's value at
# the end is compared, but that is enough - it is a nonlinear driven equation, so any deviation in the
