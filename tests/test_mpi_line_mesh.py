"""A 1-D submesh under --distribute, on a rank that gets none of it.

`Mesh::distribute()` calls `setup_tree_forest()` on **every** rank, on purpose: the call is
collective, so a rank whose partition holds none of this mesh's elements still has to enter it. For
a 1-D mesh that reaches `TemplatedMeshBase1d::setup_binary_tree_forest()`, which builds one tree
root per element and hands the vector to `oomph::BinaryTreeForest` - whose constructor called
`find_neighbours()` unconditionally, and that throws on an empty forest.

`QuadTreeForest` has had an early return for exactly this since `quadtree.cc:878`, and
`OcTreeForest` likewise; only the binary tree lacked it, so the gap was 1-D only and nothing in the
suite exercised a `LineMesh` under `--distribute`. Measured on a printhead problem whose restrictor
is a `LineMesh` of about twenty elements: rank 1 raised "Trying to setup the neighbour scheme for an
empty forest" and then segfaulted.

The 1-D mesh here shares no node with the 2-D one, which is what makes METIS put all of it on one
rank - the same reason the printhead's restrictor, coupled only through the chamber ODE's external
data, ends up undivided. Without that the test would partition the line too and never reach the
empty forest.
