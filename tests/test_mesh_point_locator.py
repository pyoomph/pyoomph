#  Mesh point location and mesh-to-mesh transfer (dev_docs/mesh_point_locator.md).
#
#  Guards the campaign that replaced oomph::MeshAsGeomObject with pyoomph's own MeshPointLocator and
#  rebuilt the transfer paths on top of it. Nearly every defect that campaign found was SILENT - a
#  wrong element matched, a field quietly zeroed, a node placed at the antipode of where it belonged -
#  so the tests here are written to pin numbers down rather than to check that things merely run.
#
#  Three kinds of assertion recur, and it is worth knowing why each is used:
#
#   * A LINEAR field is reproduced exactly by an isoparametric FE space. Interpolating one and
#     comparing against its analytic value therefore measures pure transfer error, with no
#     discretisation error mixed in. This is what exposed the old path being ~1% wrong on curved
#     elements, and the locator's Lagrangian/Eulerian mix-up in the projection.
#   * SELF-LOCATION: every integration point of a mesh must be found in that same mesh. Anything less
#     than "0 unlocated" is a defect, whatever the values look like.
#   * The INTEGRAL of the field. An exact L2 projection conserves it exactly, because constants lie in
#     the FE space and Galerkin orthogonality then gives integral(u_new - u_old) = 0. That identity is
#     far sharper than the pointwise error and is what caught the projection solving in the wrong
#     coordinate space.
