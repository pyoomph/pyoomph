# Applies pyoomph's GiNaC patches to a GiNaC source tree (run with cwd = the
# extracted GiNaC source root, i.e. the directory containing ginac/).
#
# Idempotent by design: cmake/ThirdPartyGiNaC.cmake makes the ExternalProject
# patch step depend on this script and on every *.patch beside it, so touching
# any of them re-runs the step against a tree that is already (partly) patched.
# A plain `patch -p1 -i ...` fails loudly the second time ("Reversed (or
# previously applied) patch detected!"), so each patch has to be recognised as
# already applied and skipped - while a genuine mismatch (e.g. GiNaC source
# changed unexpectedly) still aborts the build loudly.
#
# That recognition used to be "reverse-dry-run the whole patch; if it applies,
# it is already applied". That is wrong for patches that touch the same region
# of the same file, and it broke the 2026-09-22 nightly: patch 5 inserts
# exact_whole_number_exponent() and the real_part()/imag_part() preamble
# exactly into patch 4's trailing context, so against a tree carrying both,
# patch 4 no longer reverses (its hunk 1 wants power::real_part() to follow
# binomial_expansion_pow(), and now it does not) while its hunk 1 still
# *forward*-matched with fuzz somewhere else. Neither branch held and the
# script aborted on a correctly patched tree.
#
# So record what was applied instead of re-deriving it: a stamp per patch under
# $stamp_dir, holding that patch's checksum. The stamp lives inside the source
# tree, so a re-extracted tarball correctly starts over, and editing a patch
# invalidates only its own stamp. The two fallbacks below adopt a tree that was
# patched before stamps existed - including the tree the 2026-09-22 failure
# left behind - and write its stamps, so this heals in place with no need to
# blow away build/.

# The first two fix the same class of bug (GiNaC hashing the ASLR-dependent
# address of an RTTI type-name string instead of something deterministic) in
# two different spots; the third stops power::to_polynomial() recursing
# forever on a negative integer power of a power with a symbolic exponent; the
# fourth stops power::real_part()/imag_part() raising pow(0,0) on the end terms
# of their binomial expansion; the fifth lets those two use that binomial branch
# for an inexact whole-number exponent (2.0) as well, instead of falling through
# to a polar form that buries the basis in an atan2.
# See each patch's own header comment for the full rationale. Applied in
# order; add further patches to this list as found.
